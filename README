=head1 NAME

Rc - parser and backends for 'rc' shell

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Writes functionally equivalent sh/csh shell scripts from a single
input specificaion.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I have been disappointed by the lack of new development in Un*x
shells.  It seems like the world has standardized on bash/tcsh (at
best) or ksh/csh (at worst).  I believe one cause of this is the
difficulty of maintaining parallel versions of scripts for each type
of shell.  The module aims to silence that excuse and enliven shell
evolution!
