=head1 NAME

Rc - parser and backends for 'rc' shell

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  rcconvert deparse script.rc > script.rc

  rcconvert terse script.rc > script.terse

  rcconvert sh script.rc > script.sh

  rcconvert csh script.rc > script.csh

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I am disappointed by the lack of new development in Un*x shells.  It
seems like the world has standardized on bash/tcsh (at best) or
ksh/csh (at worst).  It seems that one cause of this is the difficulty
of maintaining parallel versions of scripts for each type of shell.
This module aims to silence that excuse at least.
